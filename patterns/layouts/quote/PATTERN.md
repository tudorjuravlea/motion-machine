# layouts/quote

## Purpose
A pulled line with an accent bar above it and an attribution beneath.

## Use when / Do not use when
**Use when**
- a testimonial, a principle or a line from a source
- the words carry the scene

**Do not use when**
- the quote is a sentence over about 25 words
- you are citing a number (use stat-hero)

## Params
| name | type | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `headline` | slot (text) | none | the quoted line; carries `mm-fit` |
| `attribution` | slot (text) | none | who said it, muted |
| `data-format` | html attribute | set by the kit | Reflows by `<html data-format>` for 9x16, 1x1 and 16x9. Its only param is `align` (next row). |
| `align` | enum(left|center) | the brand's `composition.align` | the layout's default comes from `--mm-align` (the brand composition, so every scene of a piece aligns alike); a beat param on any slot of the scene (`params: { "align": "center" }` or `"left"`, read as `data-p-align`) or `data-align` on the layout root overrides it either way |

## Style variables consumed
- `--mm-align`
- `--mm-color-accent`
- `--mm-color-ink`
- `--mm-color-muted`
- `--mm-density`
- `--mm-font-display`
- `--mm-font-text`
- `--mm-frame-w`
- `--mm-headline-scale`
- `--mm-safe`
- `--mm-size-body`
- `--mm-size-h1`
- `--mm-space-1`
- `--mm-space-5`
- `--mm-space-6`
- `--mm-tracking-display`
- `--mm-tracking-text`
- `--mm-weight-display`
- `--mm-weight-text`

## Legibility and rest notes
- Composition: alignment from `--mm-align`, every headline size times `--mm-headline-scale`, and the gaps and the side indent times `--mm-density` (airy 1, compact 0.6).
- Every box sits inside `--mm-safe`, inset a further 8 % of the half-width on the left and right as headroom for a camera move of up to 6 %; content is centred in that box and lifted by half a safe margin so it reads centred under the top row and slightly above the middle (H-FILL).
- Text sizes come only from `--mm-size-*` roles at body size or above, so nothing is below the body floor; data-micro is never used.
- Empty slots (no beat) are removed from the flow with `[data-empty]`, so a layout with fewer beats stays centred.
- Quotation marks belong in the beat text, not in the layout, so the language owns its own marks.
- In a deck, a slot the kit still hides (a later press has not brought it in, or it has left) takes no room, so the content that is visible is centred at that rest. The room appears when the slot arrives, so the layout re-centres at the start of that press; a film keeps the room and nothing shifts as slots arrive.

## Provenance
original

## Known limits
- 9x16 sets the quote at 1.15 times h1; about 90 characters is the most it holds before running out of height.
